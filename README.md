RCTANK Project made by: CaptainDavid73. (in progress)

Description/notes: 
This is my first real arduino project that i am making. I have been busy, researching and buying parts for almost 3 months now (28th, July, 2021). I first started of with a self made controller using an NRF24 Radio module, but that did not work in my favor, due to the preciseness of the voltage the module needs to be able to function properly. I wrestled with that problem for nearly two months, but i could not do it, so i decided to give in and buy a RC controller instead. That worked like a charm, with a pulseIn function as for the code and the reciever connected to the arduino through PWM pins. This is where i am at now. At this time i need to design and make the tank itself, which i am quite busy with. I will post the schematics and progress on the tank shortly!

Parts: (so far)
-L298N H-bridge motor driver
-12V battery pack (forL298N)
-Arduino Uno
-9V battery pack (forArduino)
-2X 12V DC motor (130RPM)
-FlySky FS-I6 Radio transmitter and reciever
-2X 360 degrees Servo
